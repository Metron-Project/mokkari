{"id":1,"name":"Black Bolt","alias":[],"desc":"Black Bolt (Blackagar Boltagon) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appears in Fantastic Four #45 (December 1965). Black Bolt is the ruler of the Inhumans, a reclusive race of genetically altered superhumans. Black Bolt's signature power is his voice, as his electron-harnessing ability is linked to the speech center of his brain. Speaking triggers a massive disturbance in the form of a highly destructive shockwave capable of leveling a city. Due to the extreme danger posed by this power, the character has undergone rigorous mental training to prevent himself from uttering a sound, even in his sleep, and he usually remains completely silent and speaks through sign language or via a spokesperson.","wikipedia":"Black_Bolt","image":"https://static.metron.cloud/media/character/2018/11/11/black-bolt.jpg","creators":[{"id":3,"name":"Jack Kirby","modified":"2019-06-23T15:13:22.311024-04:00"},{"id":4,"name":"Stan Lee","modified":"2019-06-23T15:13:23.355492-04:00"}],"teams":[{"id":473,"name":"Attilan Royal Family","modified":"2021-09-09T15:51:41.452921-04:00"},{"id":179,"name":"Illuminati","modified":"2019-07-24T17:23:21.137732-04:00"},{"id":1,"name":"Inhumans","modified":"2019-06-23T15:13:23.975156-04:00"}],"modified":"2021-09-09T15:52:49.090281-04:00"}
